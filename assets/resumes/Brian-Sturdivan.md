## Overview
With over 13 years of professional experience and 11 years of dedicated experience in the e-commerce realm, I played a pivotal role in shaping the Everlane tech stack and assembling the Engineering, Product, and Design team from the ground up. 

**Significant milestones:**
- Grew an Engineering, product and Design team by 10x
- Created Everlane's POS from scratch
- Moved the Everlane front end stack from Backbone/JQuery to React and NextJS
- Created Everlane's Ruby on Rails API layer. 

**My values:**
- Fostering an environment of trust and humility
- Advocate for and prioritize progress for the betterment of the product
- Expect and learn from successes and failures
- The collective journey is more powerful than individual accolades

I can't begin to put my experiences and contributions into just a few words but I can say that I love what I do and what we've done together.

## Experience
 
### Everlane July 2013 - current
At Everlane I was one of the founding three engineers. Together we built an e-commerce platform with a group of three rag-tag engineers and one designer; from a brand vision and mission to the successful business Everlane has become. 
#### Senior Engineering Lead
- Grew, maintained, and matured an engineering, product, and design team based on low ego, curiosity, and compassion.
- Built and managed the growth of:
  - Engineering team from 3 to 25 at its max
  - Digital Product team from 0 to 5 at its max
  - Design Team from 1 to 5 at its max
#### Senior Product Engineer | Full Stack
- **Increased customer trust and conversion**
  - Proposed and led the implementation of quick add-to-cart, related products, model is also wearing, and shop-able marketing pages
  - Integrated with a customer reviews platform and tested the effect product reviews to conversion and repeat purchases
  - Integrated with payment options in checkout such as Braintree, ApplePay, Stripe, Afterpay, and ShopPay; leading to increases in conversion by as much as 8%.
- **Empowered brand and marketing teams to self-serve**
  - Discovered, advocated for, and integrated the prototype for Everlane’s headless CMS provider, Builder.io. After spending over a year building our own custom CMS and site merchandising tool and a product asset management system; I made the decision to buy over continuing to build when the custom tools became too ineffective and engineering intensive.
  - Led the integration to a robust Digital Asset Management (DAM) system streamlining raw photo assets to customer-facing site imagery as a part of reducing redundancies by 40%
    - Decreased image sizes leading to a 32% decrease in page load time and a 4% increase in sales.
  - Increased Everlane’s SEO indexable page footprint by 400% by creating SEO and user friendly URLs for filtered product listing and search pages.

### CBS December 2011 - July 2013
#### Software Engineer | Full Stack
- Contributed to and learned from the creators of the then CBS-owned javascript library, Mootools.
- An early adopter of Node JS, I integrated with the library to build the first CNET and CBS News mobile sites—built as some of the early single-page applications deployed at scale.
