# MD to PDF Resume Generator and Watcher

Resumes don't need to be complicated or overly designed, they just need to be informative and readable by a human and an Applicant Tracking System. This small package generates a pdf file from standard markdown and styling with Github markdown styling. The resulting PDF is familiar, hierarchical, follows accessibility standards, and can be read by all major ATS software.
